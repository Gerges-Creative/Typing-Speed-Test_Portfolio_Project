                <h1>Welcome to the Typing Speed Test Game!</h1>
                <p>Challenge your typing skills across different levels, each with a unique list of words tailored to the chosen difficulty. The game is designed to push your limits and improve your typing speed. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Levels & Difficulty:</strong><br>
                  Each level presents a new challenge with a distinct set of words. The current level is <span class="lvl"></span>, where you have <span class="seconds"></span> seconds to type each word.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Extra Time for the First Word:</strong><br>
                  To get you started, you'll have an additional 3 seconds for the first word. This gives you a moment to familiarize yourself with the word set and prepare for the challenge ahead.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Word Count:</strong><br>
                  Each level contains a total of <span class="total"></span> words. Your goal is to type them as quickly and accurately as possible.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Scoring:</strong><br>
                  Your last score will be displayed on the right, while the score of your current game will be shown on the left. Can you beat your previous score?
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Select your desired level from the dropdown menu.</li>
                  <li>Press the "Start" button to begin the game.</li>
                  <li>Type the word displayed as quickly and accurately as possible.</li>
                  <li>Press "Enter" to submit each word and move to the next one.</li>
                  <li>The game ends when you complete all the words or run out of time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Good luck and have fun improving your typing speed!</p>
